For the challenge, you'll be able to go back to your chat-app application, started in the React 02 (Component) and 03 (List) quests. You're going to allow the user to change the "online" or "offline" status of a contact

Validation criteria :
• Contact is now a class component.

• Its state is initialized in the constructor (either to false, either to the value of the online prop).

• Clicking on the status indicator or on the text changes the value of online in the state.

• The display is updated accordingly.
